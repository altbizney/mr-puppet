Mr Puppet Animation System
More info on the system can be found here: https://pasquale.cool/mr-puppet

Documentation on Mr. Puppet coming soon but in the meantime here's the rough idea:
- Hardware connects to Mac over USB
- Mr. Puppet Hub receives and sends the hardware glove data 
- Mr. Puppet Studio receives Hub stream data and applies it to animation rigs in our Unity implementation
- You can hook the glove and the hub up to whatever you want
